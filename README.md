**C3P4** 

Every product manufactured leads to carbon emissions.

*PROBLEM STATEMENT* - Online Platform for apartment complexes, where apartment members can share products with other fellow residents(for example - screwdriver, hammer..) residents can request items , use it and then return it back. As the platform will make it transparent on who took what things, people will have to return it.

---

## SOLUTION

Presenting the "STAY TOGETHER, GROW TOGETHER" - an online interactive platform.

A platform where we believe that _Sharing leads to a greener world._
A user can share products for a particular period of time. Any resident who requires a product can make request by providing the detail of the product. Al the registered users will receive a notification of the request made. If any resident member has that requested equipment and if they agree to share their equipment, they can click on the check box and notify that they can share that product. The user who had made request can now approach the resident and take the product, use it and then return to the owner. In this way without using the multiple products, residents can manage to do their work and with less demand, less products will be manufactured, which in turn lead to less carbon emission. 

  * To use this site following are the steps, a resident member has to follow and can take the advantage of this interface thus a contributive step to control carbon emission:

1. Click on the link - [Directed to the website](https://myfirstonlineproject.pythonanywhere.com/)
2. If you are a new resident or a new user, you can click on 'Register' and then create a new acccount on our site.
3. Provide the required personal information like Name, Address, Phone number etc and create a Password.
4. Once registered, you can login.
5. Now, if you need a product/ equipment - click on 'Make a request of product'.
6. After that you will be directed to a new page where you have to enter the details to make request.
7. Once the request is made, all the registered residents will be notified about the request.
8. If any resident has that product and can lend him/her, then they can 'Respond to that request'.
9. The user can join the group of his society by just typing the name of the society in join group option.
10. The request will be made and the admin of the group can then accept the request.
11. The user can himself create a group for his society and add members of the society.
12. There is a comment section available below the request for any queries.
13. As soon as the request is accepted the users can contact each other through phone number.
14. The user requesting the product have to mention when he want he product and when will he return it.
